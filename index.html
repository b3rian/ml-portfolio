        <h2>Machine Learning Engineer | Turning Data into Intelligent Solutions</h2>
        <p>
          Welcome to my corner of the digital world—where algorithms meet creativity and data transforms into impact.
          I design robust machine learning systems that solve real-world problems, from predictive modeling to deep learning innovations.
          Let’s build the future, one model at a time.

          <h3>Natural Language Processing (NLP)</h3>
          <p>
            From sentiment analysis to chatbots, I engineer systems that understand and generate human language. I leverage transformers and LLMs to solve problems in search, translation, and text analytics.

          <h3>Computer Vision (CV)</h3>
          <p>
            I design models that extract meaning from pixels—whether it’s object detection, medical imaging, or autonomous systems. My work balances accuracy, speed, and real-world deployment challenges.
